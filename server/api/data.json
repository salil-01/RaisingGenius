    "query": "I have two daughters. One is 8 years and the other is 3.5 years old. The elder one is becoming a little inferior. She is afraid of asking questions because she thinks she will be scolded. As parents, we might be at fault too. What should I do? She can’t talk to anyone without fear.",
    "answer": "You can try 3 things: 1. Ask your child why she is not asking questions. Listen to her and understand her concerns. 2. Assure her that she can ask any question to mommy without fear of being scolded. Make her feel comfortable asking you anything. 3. Check with the school to see if they encourage students to ask questions."

    "query": "Namakar, when I show food to my child, he refuses to eat. But then he asks me why everyone in the house eats while watching TV. I don't know how to respond to him. He doesn't listen to anyone at home. It's not that easy, as a mother, I am doing my best. But others forget their responsibilities. In a conservative Indian society, if I say anything, they feel like I am overdoing it, as if raising a child was a piece of cake. They blame the mother for not feeding the child properly. They say she is too skinny and doesn't have good manners. As a mother, I am responsible for everything, no matter how well I take care of my child, the responsibility lies with me. No matter how good your videos are, there is a problem with the Indian mentality. I have dedicated my entire life to raising my child, making all the sacrifices, but still, I am held responsible for everything, no matter how hard I try.",
    "answer": "You are not alone in facing these challenges. It can be tough when others don't understand your parenting choices. Focus on what's best for your child. Try to have an open conversation with family members about your parenting approach and why it's essential for your child's well-being. Set consistent boundaries and rules for screen time, and make sure everyone in the family follows them. Consider spending more quality time with your child outdoors and engage in activities that you both enjoy. Remember, parenting is a journey, and it's okay to seek support and guidance from professionals or support groups if needed."

    "query": "Hii, my son is 5.5 years old. He does not like to go for any structured classes. For example, he would love to play football casually but he resists going to a class... Please help me understand why... The problem is also that if he is not going for any extracurricular activities, then it becomes very difficult to pass his time. In that case, he looks for screens for entertainment. Also, I see all other boys his age doing basketball, dance, swimming, painting classes and it makes me very worried.",
    "answer": "Hi Karishma, that’s okay. He’s young, and every child is unique in their interests and preferences. It's essential to respect his choices and not force him into structured activities if he's not comfortable with them. Instead, encourage unstructured play and free exploration. You can try introducing him to different activities and see if anything sparks his interest naturally. As for screen time, set clear boundaries and try to engage him in other activities like outdoor play, reading, or arts and crafts. Remember, each child has their own pace of development, and it's crucial to support and nurture their individual interests and passions."

    "query": "I loved the video on tantrums… I could resonate so much with it. What I had learned so far from others was not to change your stance after the child’s tantrum… otherwise, the child will learn that show tantrum and things get his way… but my experience used to tell me that my child genuinely doesn’t want to do that particular thing… I always get in dilemma… now what to do… so I try to negotiate and end it there. Like maybe play for 10 more minutes or clean it after 10 minutes… Or sometimes just change the topic. I don’t know what is right or what is wrong… but after watching your video I am assured tantrums are not all that bad.",
    "answer": "I think the key is for rules to be implemented consistently but with some flexibility if required. For example, if your daughter throws a tantrum over a specific activity, try understanding her perspective and gently explain the reasons behind your decision. If you think there is room for negotiation, communicate with her and find a middle ground. This way, she feels heard and respected, and you can still maintain the rules you've set. It's essential to be empathetic and patient during tantrums, as it's a natural part of child development. As you watch the video, remember that tantrums are a normal expression of emotions and not a reflection of your parenting skills. With time and understanding, you'll find a balance that works for both you and your child."
